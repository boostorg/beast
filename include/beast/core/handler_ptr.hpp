/** A smart pointer container with associated completion handler.

    This is a smart pointer that retains shared ownership of an
    object through a pointer. Memory is managed using the allocation
    and deallocation functions associated with a completion handler,
    which is also stored in the object. The managed object is
    destroyed and its memory deallocated when one of the following
    happens:

    @li The function @ref invoke is called.

    @li The function @ref release_handler is called.

    @li The last remaining container owning the object is destroyed.

    Objects of this type are used in the implementation of
    composed operations. Typically the composed operation's shared
    state is managed by the @ref handler_ptr and an allocator
    associated with the final handler is used to create the managed
    object.

    @note The reference count is stored using a 16 bit unsigned
    integer. Making more than 2^16 copies of one object results
    in undefined behavior.

    @tparam T The type of the owned object.

    @tparam Handler The type of the completion handler.
