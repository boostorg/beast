    with the first byte of the original sequence.

    @param n The maximum number of bytes in the wrapped
    sequence. If this is larger than the size of passed,
    buffers, the resulting sequence will represent the
    entire input sequence.

    @param buffers An instance of @b ConstBufferSequence or
    @b MutableBufferSequence to adapt. A copy of the sequence
    will be made, but ownership of the underlying memory is
    not transferred.
