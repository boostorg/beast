/** A parser for decoding HTTP/1 wire format messages.

    This parser is designed to efficiently parse messages in the
    HTTP/1 wire format. It allocates no memory when input is
    presented as a single contiguous buffer, and uses minimal
    state. It will handle chunked encoding and it understands
    the semantics of the Connection, Content-Length, and Upgrade
    fields.

    The interface uses CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern).
    To use this class, derive from @ref basic_parser. When bytes
    are presented, the implementation will make a series of zero
    or more calls to derived class members functions (referred to
    as "callbacks" from here on) matching a specific signature.

    Every callback must be provided by the derived class, or else
    a compilation error will be generated. This exemplar shows
    the signature and description of the callbacks required in
    the derived class.

    @par Derived Example

    @code
    template<bool isRequest>
    struct derived
        : basic_parser<isRequest, derived<isRequest>>
    {
        // The type used when providing a mutable
        // buffer sequence in which to store body data.
        //
        using mutable_buffers_type = ...;

        // When isRequest == true, called
        // after the Request Line is received.

        void
        on_request(
            boost::string_ref const& method,
            boost::string_ref const& path,
            int version,
            error_code& ec);

        // When isRequest == false, called
        // after the Status Line is received.
        //
        void
        on_response(
            int status,
            boost::string_ref const& reason,
            int version,
            error_code& ec);

        // Called once before the body, if any, is started.

        on_body();

        // Called zero or more times to provide body data.

            boost::string_ref const& s,
            error_code& ec);

        // Called zero or more times to retrieve a mutable
        // buffer sequence in which to store body data.
        //
        // Only used if isDirect == true
        //
        mutable_buffers_type
        on_prepare(
            std::size_t n);

        // Called after body data has been stored in the
        // buffer returned by the previous call to on_prepare.
        //
        // Only used if isDirect == true
        //
        void
        on_commit(
            std::size_t n);

        // If the Transfer-Encoding is specified, and the
        // last item in the list of encodings is "chunked",
        // called after receiving a chunk header or a final
        // chunk.
        //
        void
        on_chunk(
            std::uint64_t length,           // Length of this chunk
            boost::string_ref const& ext,   // The chunk extensions, if any
            error_code& ec);

        // Called once when the message is complete.
        // This will be called even if there is no body.
        //
        void
        on_complete(error_code& ec);
    };
    @endcode

    If a callback sets the error code, the error will be propagated
    to the caller of the parser. Behavior of parsing after an error
    is returned is undefined.

    When the parser state is positioned to read bytes belonging to
    the body, calling @ref write or @ref write will implicitly
    cause a buffer copy (because bytes are first transferred to the
    dynamic buffer). To avoid this copy, the additional functions
    @ref copy_body, @ref prepare_body, and @ref commit_body are
    provided to allow the caller to read bytes directly into buffers
    supplied by the parser.

    The parser is optimized for the case where the input buffer
    sequence consists of a single contiguous buffer. The
    @ref beast::flat_streambuf class is provided, which guarantees
    that the input sequence of the stream buffer will be represented
    by exactly one contiguous buffer. To ensure the optimum performance
    of the parser, use @ref beast::flat_streambuf with HTTP algorithms
    such as @ref beast::http::read, @ref beast::http::read_some,
    @ref beast::http::async_read, and @ref beast::http::async_read_some.
    Alternatively, the caller may use custom techniques to ensure that
    the structured portion of the HTTP message (header or chunk header)
    is contained in a linear buffer.

    @tparam isRequest A `bool` indicating whether the parser will be
    presented with request or response message.

    @tparam isDirect A `bool` indicating whether the parser interface
    supports reading body data directly into parser-provided buffers.

    @tparam Derived The derived class type. This is part of the
    Curiously Recurring Template Pattern interface.
