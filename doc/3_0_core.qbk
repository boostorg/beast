[section:core Library Basics]

A goal of the library is expose implementation primitives in order that
users may build their own library-like components. These primitives include
traits, buffers, buffer algorithms, and helpers for implementing asynchronous
operations compatible with __Asio__ and described in __N3747__. This section
lists these facilities by group, with descriptions.

[important
    This documentation assumes familiarity with __Asio__. Sample
    code and identifiers used throughout are written as if the
    following declarations are in effect:
    ```
    #include <beast/core.hpp>
    #include <boost/asio.hpp>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <thread>
 
    using namespace beast;

    boost::asio::io_service ios;
    boost::asio::io_service work{ios};
    std::thread t{[&](){ ios.run(); }};

    error_code ec;

    ```
