[section Quick Start]
[block'''<?dbhtml stop-chunking?>''']

These complete programs are intended to quickly impress upon readers
the flavor of the library. Source code and build scripts for them are
located in the example/ directory.



[section HTTP Client]

Use HTTP to make a GET request to a website and print the response:

File: [repo_file example/http-client/http_client.cpp]

[example_http_client]

[endsect]

[section WebSocket Client]

Establish a WebSocket connection, send a message and receive the reply:

File: [repo_file example/websocket-client/websocket_client.cpp]

[example_websocket_client]

[endsect]

[endsect]



[section Examples]
[block'''<?dbhtml stop-chunking?>''']

Source code and build scripts for these programs are located
in the example/ directory.



[section HTTP Crawl]

This example retrieves the page at each of the most popular domains
as measured by Alexa.

* [repo_file example/http-crawl/http_crawl.cpp]

[endsect]



[section HTTP Client (with SSL)]

This example demonstrates sending and receiving HTTP messages
over a TLS connection. Requires OpenSSL to build.

* [repo_file example/http-client-ssl/http_client_ssl.cpp]

[endsect]



[section HTTP Server (Fast)]

This example implements a very simple HTTP server with
some optimizations suitable for calculating benchmarks.

* [repo_file example/http-server-fast/fields_alloc.hpp]
* [repo_file example/http-server-fast/http_server_fast.cpp]

[endsect]



[section HTTP Server (Small)]

This example implements a very simple HTTP server
suitable as a starting point on an embedded device.

* [repo_file example/http-server-small/http_server_small.cpp]

[endsect]



[section HTTP Server (Threaded)]

This example implements a very simple HTTP server using
synchronous interfaces and using one thread per connection:

* [repo_file example/http-server-threaded/http_server_threaded.cpp]

[endsect]



[section WebSocket Client (with SSL)]

Establish a WebSocket connection over an encrypted TLS connection,
send a message and receive the reply. Requires OpenSSL to build.

* [repo_file example/websocket-client-ssl/websocket_client_ssl.cpp]

[endsect]



[section WebSocket Server (Asynchronous)]

This program implements a WebSocket echo server using asynchronous
interfaces and a configurable number of threads.

* [repo_file example/websocket-server-async/websocket_server_async.cpp]

[endsect]



[section Documentation Samples]

Here are all of the example functions and classes presented
throughout the documentation, they can be included and used
in your program without modification

* [repo_file example/doc/http_examples.hpp]

[endsect]



[section Composed Operations]

This program shows how to use Beast's network foundations to build a
composable asynchronous initiation function with associated composed
operation implementation. This is a complete, runnable version of
the example described in the Core Foundations document section.

* [repo_file example/echo-op/echo_op.cpp]

[endsect]



[section Common Code]

This code is reused between some of the examples. The header files
stand alone can be directly included in your projects.

* [repo_file example/common/detect_ssl.hpp]
* [repo_file example/common/helpers.hpp]
* [repo_file example/common/mime_types.hpp]
* [repo_file example/common/rfc7231.hpp]
* [repo_file example/common/ssl_stream.hpp]
* [repo_file example/common/write_msg.hpp]

[endsect]



[section Server Framework]

This is a complete program and framework of classes implementing
a general purpose server that users may copy to use as the basis
for writing their own servers. It serves both HTTP and WebSocket.

* [repo_file example/server-framework/file_service.hpp]
* [repo_file example/server-framework/framework.hpp]
* [repo_file example/server-framework/http_async_port.hpp]
* [repo_file example/server-framework/http_base.hpp]
* [repo_file example/server-framework/http_sync_port.hpp]
* [repo_file example/server-framework/https_ports.hpp]
* [repo_file example/server-framework/main.cpp]
* [repo_file example/server-framework/multi_port.hpp]
* [repo_file example/server-framework/server.hpp]
* [repo_file example/server-framework/service_list.hpp]
* [repo_file example/server-framework/ssl_certificate.hpp]
* [repo_file example/server-framework/ws_async_port.hpp]
* [repo_file example/server-framework/ws_sync_port.hpp]
* [repo_file example/server-framework/ws_upgrade_service.hpp]
* [repo_file example/server-framework/wss_ports.hpp]
