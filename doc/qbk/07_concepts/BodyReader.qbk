[section:BodyReader BodyReader]

A [*BodyReader] provides an online algorithm to obtain a sequence of zero
or more buffers from a body during serialization. The implementation creates
an instance of this type when needed, and calls into it one or more times to
retrieve buffers holding body octets. The interface of [*BodyReader] is
intended to obtain buffers for these scenarios:

* A body that does not entirely fit in memory.
* A body produced incrementally from coroutine output.
* A body represented by zero or more buffers already in memory.
* A body whose size is not known ahead of time.
* Body data generated dynamically from other threads.
* Body data computed algorithmically.

[heading Associated Types]

* [link beast.ref.boost__beast__http__is_body_reader `is_body_reader`]
* __Body__

[heading Requirements]

In this table:

* `R` denotes a type meeting the requirements of [*BodyReader].
* `B` denotes a __Body__ where
      `std::is_same<R, B::reader>::value == true`.
* `a` denotes a value of type `R`.
* `m` denotes a possibly const value of type `message&` where
      `std::is_same<decltype(m.body), Body::value_type>:value == true`.
* `ec` is a value of type [link beast.ref.boost__beast__error_code `error_code&`].
* `R<T>` is the type `boost::optional<std::pair<T, bool>>`.

[
    [`R::const_buffers_type`]
    []
    [
        A type which meets the requirements of __ConstBufferSequence__.
        This is the type of buffer returned by `R::get`.
    ]
][
    [`R(m);`]
    []
    [
        Constructible from `m`. The lifetime of `m` is guaranteed
        to end no earlier than after the `R` is destroyed.
        The reader shall not access the contents of `m` before the
        first call to `init`, permitting lazy construction of the
        message.

        The constructor may optionally require that `m` is const, which
        has these consequences:

        * If `R` requires that `m` is a const reference, then serializers
        constructed for messages with this body type will also require a
        const reference to a message, otherwise:

        * If `R` requires that `m` is a non-const reference, then serializers
        constructed for messages with this body type will aso require
        a non-const reference to a message.

    [`a.init(ec)`]
    []
    [
        Called once to fully initialize the object before any calls to
        `get`. The message body becomes valid before entering this function,
        and remains valid until the reader is destroyed.
        The function will ensure that `!ec` is `true` if there was
        no error or set to the appropriate error code if there was one. 
    ]
][
    [`a.get(ec)`]
    [`R<R::const_buffers_type>`]
    [
        Called one or more times after `init` succeeds. This function
        returns `boost::none` if all buffers representing the body have
        been returned in previous calls or if it sets `ec` to indicate an
        error. Otherwise, if there are buffers remaining the function
        should return a pair with the first element containing a non-zero
        length buffer sequence representing the next set of octets in
        the body, while the second element is a `bool` meaning `true`
        if there may be additional buffers returned on a subsequent call,
        or `false` if the buffer returned on this call is the last
        buffer representing the body.
        The function will ensure that `!ec` is `true` if there was
        no error or set to the appropriate error code if there was one.
