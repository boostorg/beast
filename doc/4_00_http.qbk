[section:http Using HTTP]

This library offers programmers simple and performant models of HTTP messages
and their associated operations including synchronous, asynchronous, and
buffer-oriented parsing and serialization of messages in the HTTP/1 wire
format using __Asio__. Specifically, the library provides:

[variablelist
[
    [Message Containers]
    [
        Complete HTTP messages are modeled using the __message__ class,
        with possible user customizations.
    ]
][
    [Stream Reading]
    [
        The functions
        [link beast.ref.http__read `read`],
        [link beast.ref.http__read_header `read_header`],
        [link beast.ref.http__read_some `read_some`],
        [link beast.ref.http__async_read `async_read`],
        [link beast.ref.http__async_read_header `async_read_header`], and
        [link beast.ref.http__async_read_some `async_read_some`]
        read HTTP/1 message data from a
        [link beast.concept.streams stream].
]
][
    [Stream Writing]
    [
        The functions
        [link beast.ref.http__write `write`],
        [link beast.ref.http__write_header `write_header`],
        [link beast.ref.http__write_some `write_some`],
        [link beast.ref.http__async_write `async_write`],
        [link beast.ref.http__async_write_header `async_write_header`], and
        [link beast.ref.http__async_write_some `async_write_some`]
        write HTTP/1 message data to a
        [link beast.concept.streams stream].
    ]
][
    [Serialization]
    [
        The __serializer__ produces a series of octet buffers
        conforming to the __rfc7230__ wire representation of
        a __message__.
    ]
][
    [Parsing]
    [
        The __parser__ attempts to convert a series of octet
        buffers into a __message__.
    ]

[note
    This documentation assumes some familiarity with __Asio__ and
    the HTTP protocol specification described in __rfc7230__. Sample
    code and identifiers mentioned in this section is written as if
    these declarations are in effect:
    ```
    #include <beast/http.hpp>
    using namespace beast::http;
