[section:asio Boost.Asio Refresher]

[warning
    Beast does not manage sockets, make outgoing connections,
    accept incoming connections, handle timeouts, close endpoints,
    do name lookups, deal with TLS certificates, perform authentication,
    or otherwise handle any aspect of connection management. This is
    left to the interfaces already existing on the underlying streams.
]

Library stream algorithms require an already-connected socket, SSL stream,
or other object which meets the required stream concepts and already has
communication established with an endpoint. This example is provided as a
reminder of how to work
with sockets:
```
    auto host = "www.example.com";
    boost::asio::ip::tcp::resolver r{ios};
    boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket sock{ios};
    boost::asio::connect(sock, r.resolve(
        boost::asio::ip::tcp::resolver::query{host, "http"}));

    // At this point `sock` is a connected to a remote
    // host and may be used to perform stream operations.
```

Throughout this documentation identifiers with the following names have
